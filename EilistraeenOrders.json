Fiends caused the downfall of the drow in the ancient times, and no matter what tricks they use to hide their presence or corrupt mortals, the Darksong Knights will find them and give them no quarter. This order is particularly active in the southern regions of Faerun, the area once occupied by the dark elven empire of Ilythiir, where the remnants of the fiendish magic used by the ancient Sethomiir ruling clan still linger.",
