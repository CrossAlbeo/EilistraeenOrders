                "The Silverhair Knights are an order of faithful of Eilistraee entirely dedicated to saving and redeeming the drow. Like the Darksong Knights, they embrace all Eilistraee's teachings, but focus on those regarding mercy and compassion. They take an oath to never willingly kill those who can be redeemed (all free-willed creatures), especially the drow, and regularly embark on missions to reach to their kin in the Underdark, and bring them to the light. The Silverhair Knights infiltrate in Lolthite settlements, and spend time carefully studying and observing, in order to find dark elves who need their help, who are growing resented or dissatisfied, or that are in life-or-death situations. These paladins approach the potential converts with caution, by taking many careful steps to make them feel as safe and comfortable as possible, and offer them the path to a life free of the endless strife and paranoia imposed by Lolth. The Silverhair Knights personally escort the drow to safety, and constantly offer their protection to all followers of Eilistraee, especially the new converts, in order to show that the life that the goddess wishes for her children is not a fairy tale, but a concrete possibility. Silverhair Knights can use lethal means in specific situations, but only if doing so means saving more lives. Even then, a quest for atonement is needed, given by clerics of Eilistraee. After the Second Sundering, Eilistraee herself often chooses to personally provide direct guidance to the Silverhair Knights.16 This order is home to paladins who take the Oath of Redemption, or a variation tailored to reflect Eilistraee's teachings:",

If the Silverhair Knight is not successful, the weight of allthat pain is inflicted on their own being, draining their vitality andmaking them fall into a coma for one day (it drains 1d4 points ofconstitution, which can be recovered through a Greater Restorationspell).",
